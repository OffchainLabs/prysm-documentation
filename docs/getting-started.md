## What is Prysm?
The Prysm client is being developed to provide a full-featured staking client for the Ethereum 2.0 network written entirely in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org). Originally released in early 2019 by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com), Prysm implements the official [Ethereum 'Serenity' 2.0 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs), which is the product of an ongoing collective research and development effort by various teams across the Ethereum ecosystem.

## This documentation

This manual is aimed at developers interested in exploring the Prysm 'Topaz' testnet release and reviews the concepts behind the changes made in Ethereum 2.0, as well as the core components of the Prysm client itself. Please note that, as the specification is a constantly evolving document, explanations are generally broad and comprehensive; for more detailed information or see the most recent developments, it is recommended to review the official [Ethereum 'Serenity' 2.0 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) repository and the [notes on Serenity's phases](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases).
