This section provides instructions to run [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/master/slasher) to identify and report slashable offenses on the testnet.  If slasher detects a slashable offense, proof is sent to the [beacon-chain node](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/how-prysm-works/beacon-node/) for inclusion in a block.  [Validators](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/how-prysm-works/prysm-validator-client/) earn a small whistleblower reward for including this proof into a block.  

> NOTICE: Running slasher is optional, but helps secure the chain and may result in additional earnings.

## Slashable Offenses

#### Validator slashings 
 - Double voting
   - occurs when a validator signs two different beacon blocks in the same epoch
 - Surround votes
   - occurs when a validator signs two conflicting attestations  

#### Block Proposer slashings
 - occurs when a proposer broadcasts more then one block for the same slot

## Get Prysm and start beacon-chain
> **NOTICE:** If beacon-chain is already running, skip to step 2 

1. To begin, follow the instructions for [GNU\Linux](/docs/install/linux), [macOS](/docs/install/mac), [ARM64](/docs/install/arm), or [Windows](/docs/install/windows) to fetch and install Prysm.  The beacon-chain process should be running and fully synced before proceeding.

## Run Slasher

2. Depending on your platform, issue the appropriate command alongside any [startup parameters](/docs/prysm-usage/parameters#slasher-parameters) from the examples below to start slasher.

#### Running slasher with prysm.bat on Windows

```sh
.\prysm.bat slasher
```

#### Running slasher with prysm.sh on GNU\Linux, macOS, and ARM64

```sh
./prysm.sh slasher
```

#### Running slasher with Docker on GNU\Linux, and macOS 

```text
docker pull gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/slasher:stable
docker run -it --network="host" -v $HOME/.eth2:/data --name slasher \
  gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/slasher:stable \
  --datadir=/data
```
#### Running slasher with Docker on Windows

```text
docker pull gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/slasher:stable
docker run -it --network="host" -v c:/prysm:/data gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/slasher:stable
```

#### Running slasher with Bazel on GNU\Linux, macOS, and ARM64

```text
bazel run //slasher
```

3. Slasher will spin up and immediately begin communicating with the beacon-chain process.
