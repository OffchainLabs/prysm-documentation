## What is Prysm?

The [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) project is a full-featured implementation for the Ethereum 2.0 network written entirely in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org). Created by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com), Prysm implements the official [Ethereum 2.0 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs), which is the product of an ongoing collective research and development effort by various teams across the Ethereum ecosystem including the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org).

## This documentation

This manual is aimed at developers interested in participating in Ethereum 2.0's consensus, which involves locking up a 32 ETH deposit to vote and produce blocks using our software. For more detailed information on the most recent research developments and understanding **what Ethereum 2.0 is**, it is recommended to review [Eth2Info](https://eth2.info) and the official [Ethereum 'Serenity' 2.0 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) repository.

## Communications

Prysm has two official channels for release updates: our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TvM3RWR) and our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/prysm-dev). All releases will be notified via those channels.

## Staking in Eth2

To participate in the eth2 network, read our comprehensive guidelines [here](/docs/mainnet/joining-eth2).
