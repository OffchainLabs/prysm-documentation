Prysm supports the official [Keymanager APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/keymanager-APIs), a REST API spec for validator clients to provide an alternative to CLI commands for onboarding and offboarding their validator keys on the consensus client. 

All Prysm Validator Client APIs require the use of the `--web` flag. 

Please refer to the "local keystores APIs" to manage locally stored validator keys.

Please refer to the "remote keystores APIs" to manage public key settings for Web3Signer; go to our Web3Signer docs page for more information. Prysm Web UI does not currently support this API.

## Authentication

A JWT token ( found on the second line of the auth-token file) will be generated in the prysm default wallet directory otherwise defined by `--wallet-dir` flag. the token will also be printed in the console:
```
[2022-04-15 14:07:39]  INFO rpc: http://127.0.0.1:7500/initialize?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.e30.ck3J6tcvHcI74IiFjyJqcBH-MmNAq-fMr0ncyZkGvFM
```
The token needs to be copied and set in the header of the API request:
```
Authorization: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.e30.ck3J6tcvHcI74IiFjyJqcBH-MmNAq-fMr0ncyZkGvFM`
```

## Other Prysm specific errors and usecases

Prysm comes with some client specific edge cases and usages. These cases will be documented on the [Keymanager API repos under flows](https://github.com/ethereum/keymanager-APIs/tree/master/flows/client-specific/prysm).
