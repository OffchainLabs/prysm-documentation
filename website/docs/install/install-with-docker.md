Prysm can be installed on Windows, GNU/Linux, MacOS systems with Docker. This page includes instructions for performing this method.

![Prysm Docker Setup](/img/prysm-basic-docker-setup.png)

:::tip Pro-Tip
The Prysm installation script is the easiest and most efficient way of installing the latest binaries. Instructions for using it can be found [here](/docs/install/install-with-script).

1. Ensure you are running the most recent version of Docker by issuing the command:

```text
docker -v
```

2. To pull the Prysm images, issue the following commands:

```text
docker pull gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/validator:stable
docker pull gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain:stable
```

This process will also install any related dependencies.

:::tip Pro-Tip
For advanced users, the beacon-chain and validator images with debugging tools bundled in can be fetched instead by appending `-alpine` to the end of the images in the `pull` commands above. For example: `docker pull .../prysm/validator:latest-alpine`.

Now that your installation is done, you can then read [joining eth2](/docs/mainnet/joining-eth2).

## Managing the beacon node with Docker

Below are various methods of controlling the beacon node in Docker installations.

The beacon node can be halted by either using `Ctrl+c` or with the command:

```text
docker stop beacon-node
```

To restart the beacon node, issue the following command:

```text
docker start -ai beacon-node
```

To delete a corrupted container, issue the following command:

```text
docker rm beacon-node
```

To recreate a deleted container and refresh the chain database, issue the start command with an additional `--clear-db` parameter where <YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT> is in the format of an http endpoint such as `http://host:port` (ex: `http://localhost:8545` for geth) or an IPC path such as `/path/to/geth.ipc`:

```text
docker run -it -v $HOME/.eth2:/data -p 4000:4000 -p 13000:13000 -p 12000:12000/udp --name beacon-node \
  gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain:stable \
  --datadir=/data \
  --clear-db \
  --rpc-host=0.0.0.0 \
  --monitoring-host=0.0.0.0 \
  --http-web3provider=<YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT>

:::tip Pro-Tip
It is recommended to open up port tcp/13000 and udp/12000 on your local router to improve connectivity and receive more peers from the network. To do so, navigate to `192.168.0.1` in your browser and login if required. Follow along with the interface to modify your routers firewall settings. When this task is completed, append the parameter`--p2p-host-ip=$(curl -s ident.me)` to your selected beacon startup command presented in this section to use the newly opened port.
